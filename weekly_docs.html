        The first week of our GE 112: Life and Works of Rizal summer class was an eye-opening and unexpectedly enjoyable journey into the life, legacy, and historical significance of Dr. Jose Rizal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Monday session began in a casual and welcoming atmosphere as we took turns introducing ourselves, which helped break the ice and made everyone feel at ease. Afterward, our instructor gave us a brief yet meaningful introduction to Rizal’s early life—his birth in Calamba, Laguna, his upbringing in a principled and well-educated family, and the signs of brilliance and compassion he showed even as a child.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Tuesday, we were grouped together for a collaborative activity that asked us to brainstorm and exchange questions regarding the economic, social, and political realities during the 19th century. This context gave us insight into why Rizal chose to fight, not with violence, but with words, reason, and reform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We explored Republic Act 1425 on Wednesday, understanding the law's goal of cultivating nationalism through Rizal’s works. Despite opposition from religious groups, the law prevailed—highlighting the transformative power of education and truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thursday brought creativity and laughter. We learned about Rizal’s siblings through a hilarious yet effective memory trick: singing to a watermelon. Associating sibling names with fruit parts and joking that Rizal was “7/11” made the lesson unforgettable.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Friday, a high-energy group relay game helped reinforce the week’s lessons. The mix of challenge and fun fostered both learning and teamwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        This week redefined learning. It reminded us that Rizal was not just a textbook figure but a real person with a heart, vision, and voice that still resonates today.

        The second week of our GE 112: Life and Works of Rizal summer class offered a deeper exploration of the man behind the national hero—his roots, his intellect, his writings, and even his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        We began Monday with a brief but effective review of the previous week’s lessons, reinforcing our understanding of Rizal’s early life, family background, and the socio-political climate of the 19th century. Afterward, we learned about Rizal’s hereditary influences—his lineage connecting him to Chinese, Spanish, and Filipino roots. His mother, Teodora Alonso, stood out as a key figure in nurturing his gifts, showing us how Rizal's brilliance was shaped by generations of intellectual discipline and cultural depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Tuesday, we were tasked with forming one meaningful question related to the day’s topic—a simple activity that sparked deeper thinking. We also began preparing for our group reporting activity. Group 1 tackled Rizal’s overseas journeys, highlighting the places he studied and how travel shaped his reformist ideals. Group 2 explored Rizal’s poetry, examining his use of language, emotion, and nationalism. Our group, Group 3, took on Rizal’s novels, <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> and <em>El Filibusterismo</em>, analyzing their characters and the colonial injustices they exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Wednesday and Thursday, we presented our reports. Each one gave us a new lens to view Rizal—not just as a historical figure but as a world traveler, a lyrical poet, and a daring novelist. His openness to learning and courage in speaking truth to power came alive through every presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Friday offered an emotional shift in tone as we explored Rizal’s romantic life. Our instructor introduced us to the nine women linked to him, offering a glimpse into Rizal’s personal experiences with love, vulnerability, and longing. Among them, Josephine Bracken stood out as the woman most closely connected to his final years. Despite challenges, including family disapproval and personal tragedy—the heartbreaking death of their child—they stayed together until his last moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        This week helped us move beyond Rizal’s activism and writings to see the man in full: a product of noble ancestry, a scholar, a romantic, and a deeply compassionate human being. It was a reminder that even our greatest heroes are also deeply human—shaped by joy, pain, love, and loss.

        The third week of our GE 112: Life and Works of Rizal summer class was a dynamic blend of continued learning,
        performance preparation, and academic assessments.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Monday, we resumed our group reports, particularly focusing on Rizal’s novels, <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> and
        <em>El Filibusterismo</em>. Our group presented detailed insights into the themes, characters, and political
        messages embedded in these literary masterpieces. It was a fulfilling continuation from the previous week,
        allowing us to fully appreciate how Rizal used literature as a powerful weapon against colonial injustice.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Tuesday, our attention shifted from analysis to performance, as we began practicing for our speech choir
        presentation of Rizal’s poem <em>Mi Primera Inspiración</em>. This poem, dedicated to his mother, captures the
        depth of Rizal’s emotions and his literary grace. Our instructor emphasized that the presentation must be
        flawless, as an exceptional performance would grant us exemption from the midterm exam, giving us all the
        motivation to rehearse seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Wednesday, we took part in a group activity quiz that tested our knowledge of last week’s lessons,
        including Rizal’s travels, poetry, and romantic relationships. Our group earned a score of 18 points, which we
        considered a success and a sign of our growing understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thursday was a bit unusual as our instructor was absent, but we made productive use of the day by continuing
        our speech choir rehearsals, which had noticeably improved compared to our earlier practices. Everyone
        contributed their energy and effort, making the delivery more synchronized, emotional, and impactful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, on Friday, we took our preliminary exam via Google Forms, which covered lessons from Week 1 to Week
        3. Although exams can be stressful, this one allowed us to reflect on how much we had learned in a short time.
        Despite completing the preliminary exam, our instructor mentioned that discussions would continue until the
        final third week, confirming that our summer course would span a total of six weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, this week balanced creativity, collaboration, and evaluation, all of which helped strengthen our
        grasp of Rizal’s life and legacy, not only through facts but through expression, teamwork, and personal
        reflection.

      <p>
        This week may have been different from the usual, since our instructors were away attending a seminar, but it
        turned out to be one of the most meaningful weeks for me. Without regular lectures, we shifted our full
        attention to preparing for the speech choir performance of Rizal’s poem <em>Mi Primera Inspiración</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this activity, I discovered the true value of teamwork, creativity, and experiential learning. We had
        to schedule rehearsals, plan costumes, and ensure everyone participated and contributed. It wasn’t always
        smooth—we faced disagreements, clashing schedules, and moments when motivation dipped. But these challenges
        taught us that some of the most powerful learning happens not in books or tests, but in shared effort and
        real-world collaboration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important lesson I learned was the power of teamwork and shared responsibility. I gained discipline,
        patience, and a better understanding of how to adapt and communicate effectively. These lessons are especially
        valuable to me as a future science teacher. Time management, coordination, and clear communication are just as
        crucial in the classroom as they are in performances.
      </p>
      <p>
        What made this experience even more enriching was the emotional connection we formed with the poem. <em>Mi
        Primera Inspiración</em> became more than a literary piece—it transformed into a heartfelt message of love
        and dedication. We paid attention to every detail: facial expressions, vocal tone, body movement, and costume
        choices—all aimed at delivering Rizal’s message more powerfully and personally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our rehearsals and final performance stood out as the highlight of the week. They showed how a creative task
        can become a deep reflection of culture, history, and emotion. It was a vivid reminder of how powerful and
        meaningful education can be when it goes beyond the classroom walls.
      </p>
      <p>
        This week proved that learning doesn't always require lectures or exams. By being creative, working together,
        and committing to a shared goal, I learned lessons that will stay with me both as a student and as a future
        educator. This experience reminded me that teaching is not just about knowledge—it's also about passion,
        flexibility, and heart.

      <p>
        This week gave me one of the most challenging yet meaningful experiences in our study of Rizal. I was assigned
        to portray Juan Crisóstomo Ibarra in a dramatic monologue, and it wasn’t just about memorizing lines—it was
        about embodying a complex character full of hope, pain, and resistance. The process was a deep dive not only
        into performance but also into Rizal’s message and the truths behind <em>Noli Me Tangere</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the biggest challenges was being the first to perform. It came with immense pressure, as I had to set
        the tone and standard for the rest of the class. Ibarra is not an easy character to portray—he is idealistic
        yet disillusioned, gentle yet determined. To understand him fully, I had to look beyond the script. I
        revisited chapters of the novel, watched stage adaptations, and explored literary interpretations of his
        character. I also rehearsed several times, making adjustments based on peer feedback to improve my tone,
        emotion, and delivery.
      </p>
      <p>
        This activity also led me to think more deeply about Rizal’s evolving philosophy. Did he always believe in
        peaceful reform, or did he begin to lean toward revolution, as hinted through Simoun in <em>El
        Filibusterismo</em>? The contrast between Ibarra and Simoun made me reflect on how Rizal's own views may
        have shifted over time. I even started wondering—if Rizal were alive today, would he use modern platforms like
        social media, theater, or film to awaken national consciousness? Would he still challenge the injustices we
        face now?
      </p>
      <p>
        Of all our learning tasks this week, the dramatic monologue was the most impactful. It pushed me to not only
        understand Ibarra’s story but to feel his struggles. Even the process of preparing the costume had meaning—I
        researched the attire of the <em>ilustrado</em> class to better represent the character and setting. Every
        detail helped me connect more deeply with Rizal’s time and the revolutionary ideas he fought for.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end, this week was far more than just a performance—it was a powerful learning experience. I gained a
        deeper appreciation for Rizal’s courage and how he wielded literature as a weapon for change. I also learned
        that representing history requires both intellect and emotion. This experience reminded me of the power of art
        to reflect society, question it, and inspire a better future.

        Week 6 marked a significant moment in our Rizal class, as we finally completed and presented our character
        portrayals. It was a fulfilling experience to see all our hard work and preparation come together in front of
        the audience. Each member of the class brought something unique to the performance—whether through costumes,
        line delivery, or emotional expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of us crafted our lines creatively, drawing inspiration from the novels we studied, especially <em>Noli
        Me Tangere</em> and <em>El Filibusterismo</em>. Although there were a few small distractions during the
        performance, we managed to stay composed and deliver a well-executed presentation. It was clear that everyone
        took the task seriously and gave their best effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the second day of the week, we didn’t have class. While it may seem like a regular break, it turned out to
        be a much-needed chance to rest and recharge after weeks of rehearsals and academic pressure. I realized how
        important rest is—it's not a waste of time, but a necessary part of the learning process.

        By Wednesday, our instructor informed us that all our outputs from the previous weeks had been submitted,
        which came as a big relief. We were also reminded about the upcoming deadline for our e-portfolio. This served
        as a wake-up call for me to check my submissions, review my work, and make sure everything was organized and
        complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our instructor also showed us our midterm grades and encouraged us to raise any concerns, particularly about
        our class standing or portfolio requirements. I appreciated this open communication—it reminded me that
        teachers are not just there to evaluate us, but also to guide and support us.
      </p>

        This week taught me more than just how to perform or complete academic requirements. I learned the value of
        preparation, collaboration, and personal responsibility. Performing in front of others demanded confidence,
        but that confidence was built through practice and teamwork. I also understood the importance of balancing
        schoolwork with self-care and reflection.
      </p>
      <p>
        In conclusion, Week 6 was both productive and meaningful. It allowed me to witness the results of our
        collective effort, reflect on my individual growth, and prepare for the final stretch of the course. Whether
        through performance or quiet reflection, I was reminded that learning takes many forms—and all of them matter.

        GE 112: Life and Works of Rizal, I can truly say that this subject offered more than just academic knowledge—
        it offered personal growth, emotional insight, and a deeper connection to our nation’s history. What started as
        a summer class quickly became an eye-opening experience that helped me understand Rizal not just as a name in
        textbooks, but as a real person with values, struggles, and a purpose that still speaks to us today.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each week brought something new and meaningful. From learning about Rizal’s childhood and family to analyzing
        his novels and reenacting his characters, every activity made me reflect on my own identity as a Filipino. I
        was especially moved by the character portrayal activity, where I stepped into the role of Juan Crisóstomo
        Ibarra. It pushed me out of my comfort zone and reminded me that understanding history isn't just about facts—
        it's about empathy and storytelling. Similarly, the group performance of <em>Mi Primera Inspiración</em> taught
        me the importance of collaboration and expression. I saw how poetry, like science, can also be a tool for
        awakening minds and hearts.
      </p>

      <p>
        I appreciated that our class wasn’t limited to lectures. Activities like group reporting, creative performances,
        film analysis, and collaborative quizzes turned learning into a dynamic experience. They made me realize that
        Rizal’s life and works are not just historical content—they are lessons we can still apply in today’s world.
        Through these tasks, I developed skills in communication, critical thinking, teamwork, and even stage confidence—
        all of which will help me in my future career as a science educator.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond all the outputs and scores, what I value most are the reflections this course inspired. I often found
        myself wondering: What would Rizal do if he were alive today? Would he speak through social media, films, or
        modern art? Would he still challenge the system with the same courage? These questions made me think more
        deeply about my own voice—how I can use it to educate, inspire, and lead with compassion and integrity.
      </p>

      <p>
        This e-portfolio represents more than the completion of a subject—it’s a personal milestone. It holds not just
        my outputs, but my realizations, values, and hopes. Rizal once said, <em>“Ang hindi marunong lumingon sa
        pinanggalingan ay hindi makararating sa paroroonan.”</em> Through this journey, I’ve learned that honoring the
        past is key to shaping a better future. I hope to carry Rizal’s spirit into my own life: to be curious,
        courageous, and committed to making a difference.
