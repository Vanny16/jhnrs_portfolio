        The first week of our GE 112: Life and Works of Rizal summer class was an eye-opening and unexpectedly enjoyable journey into the life, legacy, and historical significance of Dr. Jose Rizal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our Monday session began in a casual and welcoming atmosphere as we took turns introducing ourselves, which helped break the ice and made everyone feel at ease. Afterward, our instructor gave us a brief yet meaningful introduction to Rizal’s early life—his birth in Calamba, Laguna, his upbringing in a principled and well-educated family, and the signs of brilliance and compassion he showed even as a child.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Tuesday, we were grouped together for a collaborative activity that asked us to brainstorm and exchange questions regarding the economic, social, and political realities during the 19th century. This context gave us insight into why Rizal chose to fight, not with violence, but with words, reason, and reform.
      </p>
      <p>
        We explored Republic Act 1425 on Wednesday, understanding the law's goal of cultivating nationalism through Rizal’s works. Despite opposition from religious groups, the law prevailed—highlighting the transformative power of education and truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thursday brought creativity and laughter. We learned about Rizal’s siblings through a hilarious yet effective memory trick: singing to a watermelon. Associating sibling names with fruit parts and joking that Rizal was “7/11” made the lesson unforgettable.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Friday, a high-energy group relay game helped reinforce the week’s lessons. The mix of challenge and fun fostered both learning and teamwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        This week redefined learning. It reminded us that Rizal was not just a textbook figure but a real person with a heart, vision, and voice that still resonates today.

      <p>
        The second week of our GE 112: Life and Works of Rizal summer class offered a deeper exploration of the man behind the national hero—his roots, his intellect, his writings, and even his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        We began Monday with a brief but effective review of the previous week’s lessons, reinforcing our understanding of Rizal’s early life, family background, and the socio-political climate of the 19th century. Afterward, we learned about Rizal’s hereditary influences—his lineage connecting him to Chinese, Spanish, and Filipino roots. His mother, Teodora Alonso, stood out as a key figure in nurturing his gifts, showing us how Rizal's brilliance was shaped by generations of intellectual discipline and cultural depth.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Tuesday, we were tasked with forming one meaningful question related to the day’s topic—a simple activity that sparked deeper thinking. We also began preparing for our group reporting activity. Group 1 tackled Rizal’s overseas journeys, highlighting the places he studied and how travel shaped his reformist ideals. Group 2 explored Rizal’s poetry, examining his use of language, emotion, and nationalism. Our group, Group 3, took on Rizal’s novels, <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> and <em>El Filibusterismo</em>, analyzing their characters and the colonial injustices they exposed.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Wednesday and Thursday, we presented our reports. Each one gave us a new lens to view Rizal—not just as a historical figure but as a world traveler, a lyrical poet, and a daring novelist. His openness to learning and courage in speaking truth to power came alive through every presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Friday offered an emotional shift in tone as we explored Rizal’s romantic life. Our instructor introduced us to the nine women linked to him, offering a glimpse into Rizal’s personal experiences with love, vulnerability, and longing. Among them, Josephine Bracken stood out as the woman most closely connected to his final years. Despite challenges, including family disapproval and personal tragedy—the heartbreaking death of their child—they stayed together until his last moments.
      </p>
      <p>
        This week helped us move beyond Rizal’s activism and writings to see the man in full: a product of noble ancestry, a scholar, a romantic, and a deeply compassionate human being. It was a reminder that even our greatest heroes are also deeply human—shaped by joy, pain, love, and loss.

      <p>
        The third week of our GE 112: Life and Works of Rizal summer class was a dynamic blend of continued learning, performance preparation, and academic assessments.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Monday, we resumed our group reports, particularly focusing on Rizal’s novels, <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> and <em>El Filibusterismo</em>. Our group presented detailed insights into the themes, characters, and political messages embedded in these literary masterpieces. It was a fulfilling continuation from the previous week, allowing us to fully appreciate how Rizal used literature as a powerful weapon against colonial injustice.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Tuesday, our attention shifted from analysis to performance, as we began practicing for our speech choir presentation of Rizal’s poem <em>Mi Primera Inspiración</em>. This poem, dedicated to his mother, captures the depth of Rizal’s emotions and his literary grace. Our instructor emphasized that the presentation must be flawless, as an exceptional performance would grant us exemption from the midterm exam, giving us all the motivation to rehearse seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Wednesday, we took part in a group activity quiz that tested our knowledge of last week’s lessons, including Rizal’s travels, poetry, and romantic relationships. Our group earned a score of 18 points, which we considered a success and a sign of our growing understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thursday was a bit unusual as our instructor was absent, but we made productive use of the day by continuing our speech choir rehearsals, which had noticeably improved compared to our earlier practices. Everyone contributed their energy and effort, making the delivery more synchronized, emotional, and impactful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, on Friday, we took our preliminary exam via Google Forms, which covered lessons from Week 1 to Week 3. Although exams can be stressful, this one allowed us to reflect on how much we had learned in a short time. Despite completing the preliminary exam, our instructor mentioned that discussions would continue until the final third week, confirming that our summer course would span a total of six weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, this week balanced creativity, collaboration, and evaluation, all of which helped strengthen our grasp of Rizal’s life and legacy, not only through facts but through expression, teamwork, and personal reflection.
